# InstacartBasketAnalysis
Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. My task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

# Key Questions
● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.

● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.

● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.

# Tools
The tools used for this analysis is python. The different libraries were used in python fot this prooject: 
● Panda
● Numpy
● Seaborn
● Matplotlib
● Scipy

# Data
I used 5 data sets for this project: 
● Order 
● Orders_products_prior
● Products
● Customers 
● Departments

# Project Folders 
The project folders are split up into: 
 - Project Management: Brief and details about the project.
 - Scripts: Jupyter notebooks with codes
 - Analysis: Contains a folder with the visualizations from the analysis.
 - Data: This consist of two sub folders named "Original Data" and "Prepared data". Original data is the inital data for the analysis and Prepared data is data which has been cleaned and transformed from analysis.
 - Sent to Client: Consist of Final document from the analsysis.
